# Custom configuration for NvChad
Custom configuration for [NvCad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad).
## Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/schillermann/nvchad-custom.git ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom
```
### Nerd Fonts
NvCad needs [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for display of the icons.
In [patched-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts) you can find many Fonts like the popular Hack.
Go in one of these Font folders and copy the 3 files ending with `Complete.ttf` for Regular, Italic and Bold in your local folder `/usr/local/share/fonts`.
